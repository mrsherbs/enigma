<p>Historically accurate simulation of the 1942 M4 Naval Enigma Machine</p>

<br>

<ul>
    <li>Enigma is fully reversible: it uses the same process for encryption and decryption.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>When you encrypt a message with Enigma, you can decrypt it by applying the same machine settings and plugging in the ciphered text.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>The plugboard only accepts pairs of 2 letters.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Enigma had no spacebar or backspace key, so historical messages are often difficult to read. I've formatted and added punctuation to them here to make them readable.</li>
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>Historical messages are sourced from https://enigma.hoerenberg.com/.</li>
